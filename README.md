# Spot2You
A program that takes you Spotify playlists and mirrors them onto Youtube.  Granted you can only do ~70 songs a day due to Youtube's request limitations.

## Requirements

- Python3
  - Spotipy
  - google-api-python
  - google-auth-oauthlib 
 
# Installations
  You can find instruction on how to install the Google's APIs at https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python.
  Simalarily you can find Spotify's API at https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/#installation.
  Both links show you how to set up a developer account with them and where the client secrets are. Note: For Youtube's APIs you will need to copy and paste a json file into the folder.
  

# Extras

This code heavily references Quickify by GrantQuick at https://github.com/GrantQuick/Quickify/tree/d2e77e434341056b46da80fa5df407d0672a4259, thank you very much I could have never figured out the youtube part of the code without it. I still barely understand the authentification section.

Use any of the code as you want, .
